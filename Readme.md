# VERY TO-DO.

## HelperFunctions.cpp
* Just a small collection of functions I _used_ to help me in my console programs _back when_ I started coding.
* Not tested, maybe not correct, efficiency is a joke, but it's the solution _I use_.
* You are mostly better off with some other solution, you have been **warned**.
* If you are new to programming, this _might be_ a nice mini project.
